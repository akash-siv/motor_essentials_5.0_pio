# Instructions

## Soil Moisture sensor.
* Soil moisture sensor should not be placed near the plants or near irrigation lines of the plants.
* Soil moisture sensor is placed in an area thus it only read the moisture with respect to rain.

## Features
* Features like Dry run, Recurring motor ON/OFF and Low voltage sensing can be easily turned on or off in the define statement, thus reducing the program memory.

## Preferred Board
* ESP-32 (38 Pin NodeMCU 32s)
